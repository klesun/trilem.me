                            <li>There are three players, codenamed
                                <span data-owner="KEANU"><span class="player-name-holder">KEANU</span></span>,
                                <span data-owner="TRINITY"><span class="player-name-holder">TRINITY</span></span> and
                                <span data-owner="MORPHEUS"><span class="player-name-holder">MORPHEUS</span></span>,
                                each starts at one of the three tiles in the center of the board
                            </li>
                            <li>Every turn each player chooses one of up to three directions to move his triangular
                                representation or skips his turn by pressing <i>Esc</i>. If there is nowhere to go, turn is skipped automatically
                            </li>
                            <li>Stepping on any tile makes you it's owner: coloring it with your color, making it an
                                obstacle for enemies and increasing your respective resource quantity if it yields one
                            </li>
                            <li>There are three kinds of resources randomly placed on some tiles:
                                <span data-resource="WHEAT">Wheat</span>,
                                <span data-resource="OIL">Oil</span> and
                                <span data-resource="GOLD">Gold</span>.
                                Owned resources form your total score by formula:
                                <span data-resource="WHEAT">Wheat</span> x
                                <span data-resource="OIL">Oil</span> x
                                <span data-resource="GOLD">Gold</span> +
                                <span data-resource="EMPTY">Empty</span>.
                                Each player starts with 1 permanent unit of each resource.
                                Here is an example: if you captured
                                2 tiles of <span data-resource="WHEAT">Wheat</span>,
                                2 tiles of <span data-resource="OIL">Oil</span>,
                                2 tiles of <span data-resource="GOLD">Gold</span> and
                                2 tiles of <span data-resource="EMPTY">Empty</span>, your total score is
                                <code>(1 + 2) x (1 + 2) x (1 + 2) + 2 = 29</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>When there are no more turns left, the player with the greatest total score becomes the winner</li>
                            <li>You can step on an enemy owned tile, this will make it belong to you, but if this tile does not hold a resource,
                                you skip <span data-balance-value="TURNS_SKIPPED_ON_CAPTURING_EMPTY">?</span> turn(s) after that as a penalty
                            </li>
                            <li>You can not step on a tile on which another player is currently standing. You can neither
                                step on <i>Dead Space</i> randomly placed in place of some tiles on the board
                            </li>
